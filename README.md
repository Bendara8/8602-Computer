# 8602 Computer
Tools, Simulator, CAD, and Documentation for the 8602 Discreet Logic Computer

## About
The 8602 (_pronounced "eight-six-oh-two"_) is a minimalistic 8-bit computer built almost entirely of simple discreet logic chips from the 74HC logic family. Despite its simplicity, it features a VGA output and a PS/2 keyboard input, and can be easily expanded with additional I/O. The name 8602 is representative of its two primary inspirations: the Intel 8086 and the MOS 6502. The 8602 aims to be similar in capability and feature set to the 8086, while retaining the simplicity and overall feel of the 6502.
