The simulator, although functional, is currently incomplete. To be fully usuable more chips need to be added. However, for now it will be left in its incomplete state since the circuits that it was built to validate have been tested. There are some known bugs in the circuit definition parser, and so use of the code is not reccomended as of now. Currently there are no plans to complete this software. At some point I plan to reuse the core architecture of the simulator in a more fleshed out circuit cimulator project.
